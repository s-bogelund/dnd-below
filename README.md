This is a full stack summer project to try out technologies that I'm not familiar with.

It is a PWA where you can create, save, and update your Dungeons & Dragons characters. If you're logged in, they are saved to your user and you can access them on all devices. Otherwise they are stored locally.

Built with

Frontend:

1. React
2. TypeScript
3. Tailwind
4. DaisyUI

Backend:

1. Next.js
2. Sanity CMS

Special thanks to Chris Ward for creating an awesome DnD 5e API (https://github.com/5e-bits/5e-srd-api) which is used extensively in this application.
